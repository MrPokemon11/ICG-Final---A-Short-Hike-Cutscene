# ICG-Final-Project

A small scene for my Intermediate Computer Graphics class based on A Short Hike



###### Acknoledgements

A Short Hike created by Adam Gryu



Dependency Hunter created by AlexeyPerov on GitHub (https://github.com/AlexeyPerov/Unity-Dependencies-Hunter)

* Did no end up getting used



Everything within "Assignment Assets" was created by me



All other assets were extracted from the game using AssetRipper

* Some of the original scripts were removed/edited due to issues related to Unity version
